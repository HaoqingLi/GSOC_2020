## Overview
This document provides a descrption of the work developed for [GNSS-SDR](https://gnss-sdr.org/) during the Google Summer of Code 2020 program. This project intended to extend the capabilities of the GNSS-SDR software by providing implementation of [robust anti-jamming processing](https://github.com/HaoqingLi/gnss-sdr).

# Team
Mentor: Gerald Lamountain, Pau Closas 

Developer: Haoqing Li 

# Project
This project aimed to degrade influence of jamming signals by introduing robust version of cross-ambiguity functions (CAFs) with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator under heavy tailed distribution and M-estimator to reveiver. This project’s objectives were:

1. Implementation of robustion pre-correlation processing in time domain in both acquisisition and tracking blck.
2. Implementation of robustion pre-correlation processing in frequency domain in both acquisisition and tracking blck.
